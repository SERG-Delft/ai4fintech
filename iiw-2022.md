Research ideas are much more than a seed for brilliant academic papers.
In this workshop, we invite you to explore and reflect about the societal impact of your PhD ideas. It can be in the form of a concrete product, an open source tool, a start-up, a novel way of working, you name it.

Throughout the day, we will explore different strategies to achieve this impact, such as involving (master) students, involving software engineers or business developers, finding launching customers, attracting venture capital, creating an open source community, and so on.

We want this to be a creative day where the only limit to our possibilities is our own imagination -- think big, and anything is possible.
