Notes:
- it would be nice to record these pitches. They would git well the social media platform and we could be posting throughout the next months. 
- It would be nice to have the best pitch award and the most creative pitch award. (These awards look nice in their cv and would definitely cheer up at least these 2 PhD students.)
- I'm giving 1 hour per pitch event: 4min intro + 8 students * (2min pitch + 5min discussion)  = 60min
- During group sessions, students improve their pitch or create a new one but all of them will pitch again.
- Should we invite students to do a different pitch in the afternoon session?
- the mic picture will be a jumbotron but I'll need another iteration to improve the design
