This repo contains the sources of the AI4Fintech website.
The website is built on top of the popular open-source static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and makes use of the [Wowchemy](https://wowchemy.com/) framework.
The [Netlify](https://gohugo.io/) service is used to host the website.

## Build and preview locally

When making changes to the website, it is useful to build and preview the website locally before committing the changes to the repository.
Before you can build the website, you first need to install the following dependencies:

1. Install Hugo using [this documentation](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/).
2. Install NPM using [this documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

To preview the website:

1. Run `view.sh`

When an error occurs during building, try deleting the local Hugo cache:

- MacOS/Linux: `sudo rm -rf $TMPDIR/hugo_cache/`

## Deploy website

The website is automatically deployed whenever a new commit is merged into the main branch.
