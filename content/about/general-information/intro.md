# AI for Fintech Research

ING has teamed up with Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) to set up the AI for Fintech Research (AFR) lab. 
Here we combine our knowledge and expertise on the use of artificial intelligence in the financial industry. AFR is part of the Dutch <a href="https://icai.ai/" style="color: #FF6201; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Innovation Centre for Artificial Intelligence</a>.



## Mission statement
Our mission is to carry out world-class research into artificial intelligence, data analytics and software analytics in the context of financial technology (fintech). 

With millions of customers and thousands of employees worldwide, software and data analytics are at the heart of ING's business and operations. AFR seeks to develop new AI-driven theories, methods and tools in large-scale data and software analytics. Advances in AI are redefining the way the financial services sector is using data analytics and new technologies. AI enables us to offer personalized and relevant customer journeys while making ING a safer and more compliant bank.

Our research has two goals: to <span style="color:#FF6201"> **create** </span> impact for ING and to <span style="color:#FF6201"> **share** </span> our findings at top-level conferences.

## How do we work?

AFR consists of 11 research tracks, in which 11 PhD students work on topics such as software analytics, data integration, fairness in machine learning, model lifecycle management, regulatory compliance, search-based software engineering, and A/B testing.
Each track involves ING engineers as well as researchers, professors and other students from TU Delft.
AFR is bi-located at the ING’s head office <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/ING+Cedar/@52.3155919,4.9498284,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x64ee767a91985a24!8m2!3d52.3155919!4d4.9498284" style="color: #FF6201; text-decoration: underline;text-decoration-style: dotted;">Cedar</a> in Amsterdam and on the TU Delft campus.
