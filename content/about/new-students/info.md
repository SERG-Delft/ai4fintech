Contact ai4fintech@ing.com to join us! AFR will give you an opportunity to work on complex computer science solutions, develop scalable, distrubuted software systems, and also collaborate with multiple stakeholders in real-world scenarios. We have a strong focus on training students to become top-notch computer scientists and create real-world impact through strong scientific and technical contributions. 

If you study at a different university and you would like to write a research master thesis in the context of one of the AFR tracks, you should ask your university supervisor to contact us. We have limited places available, but are always interested in new research opportunities.
