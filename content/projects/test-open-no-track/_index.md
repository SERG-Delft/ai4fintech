# Short description of the project
description: >
  Incidents related to server outages can lead to unscheduled system downtime, unplanned costs and heavily affect the end user. Early detection of unfavorable system conditions can help in prevention of incidents or help in avoiding escalation to major level. To that end, we are integrating predictive analytics into an alerting solution for incidents at ING. This solution monitors server metrics on a stack to identify anomalous events and set up early warnings on potential problems.
