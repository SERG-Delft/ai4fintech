# Name of the project
title: "Factors Affecting On-Time Epic Delivery in Agile Software Development"

# Short description of the project
description: >
  In order to improve epic predictability at ING, it is essential to better understand which factors affect the timing of software deliveries in large-scale agile development. We conducted a case study at ING to explore which factors affect schedule deviation in epic deliveries and how these factors are related. We developed a conceptual model following a mixed-methods approach. Our analysis was based on survey data and data collected from the software delivery pipeline at ING.
