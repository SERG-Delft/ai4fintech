# Track 5: Continuous Experimentation

Continuous experimentation for consumer facing software is the practice to roll out features in a controlled way, measuring their impact on key performance indicators as much as possible.
This track connects the end user behavior (as measured through interactions with the software) with the software development teams that make decisions about feature implementations, thus closing the value chain from developer to end user.

Topics of interest include A/A and A/B testing, optimal statistical procedures, feature and variability management, reducing experiment duration while keeping track of long term objectives, and the identification of overall evaluation criteria as well as guard rail metrics.
The resulting metrics and measurement platforms will facilitate (machine) learning as well as (simulated) search-based optimization of the overall platform.
