# Track 4: Deploying ML Models at Scale

The deployment of ML-applications brings in a unique set of engineering challenges. In particular if models are re-trained and re-deployed frequently, full automation of all relevant deployment tasks is needed. This includes monitoring and optimization in production, as well as data quality validation. For models requiring explainability, verification of not just outputs but also of the revised explanations will be necessary.
In this track we will seek to address such challenges at ING scale.
