The data integration track recognizes the importance of data for almost any application of artificial intelligence at ING.
ING is a data-rich organization. Its data lake constitutes a federation of different data storage types. A plethora of applications exchange data streams. The relationships between the many different data sources evolve over time, and are hard to predict and manage.

The goal of this track is to use semantics-based data matching to recognize such data relationships automatically. In particular, we apply machine learning for the purpose of meta-data matching, automated schema discovery, schema evolution, and schema alignment. The results can be used to support data engineers to make data integration decisions by means of dataset exploration, discovery, and integration recommendation.

The context is the ING cloud infra-service platform, which continuously collects operational data from a large range of private cloud services operated by ING across layers.

Research results include:

- Valentine, a framework for matching tabular data at scale.
- An adaptive distributed streaming solution for similarity joins. It employs a stream partitioning scheme that provides fine-grained partitions, which ensure the completeness of the results while reducing the number of unnecessary computations.
- An open-source streaming dataflow testbed that allows for accurate and isolated comparison of different checkpointing protocols and can be easily extended to compare other stream processing mechanisms.
- The first principled evaluation framework for stream processing autoscalers

The results have been presented at top conferences in the area of databases.
The results are collectively described in the dissertation of PhD candidate George Siachamis (defense date: November 2024).
