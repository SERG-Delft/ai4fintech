# Track 2: Data Integration

The data integration track recognizes the importance of data for almost any application of artificial intelligence at ING.
ING is a data-rich organization. Its data lake constitutes a federation of different data storage types. The relationships between the many different data sources evolve over time, and are hard to predict and manage.

The goal of this track is to use semantics-based data matching to recognize such data relationships automatically. In particular, machine learning will be applied for the purpose of meta-data matching, automated schema discovery, schema evolution, and schema alignment. The results can be used to support data engineers to make data integration decisions by means of dataset exploration, discovery, and integration recommendation.

The context in which this will take place is the ING cloud infra-service platform, which continuously collects operational data from a large range of private cloud services operated by ING across layers.
