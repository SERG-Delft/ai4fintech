The research area of software analytics seeks to leverage data collected from software engineering processes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of these processes. Data collected for these purposes include issues, log data, source code repositories, epic descriptions, etc. Thanks to the abundance of data, it becomes increasingly viable to apply machine learning techniques (e.g., random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) to use historic development information to support current development activities.

In the ING context, this is particularly relevant for the over 600 teams involved in software development. A key concern is epic predictability and epic delay which are addressed within this track. The research has focused on delay factors, dynamic delay prediction, team dynamics, and automated sprint optimization.
