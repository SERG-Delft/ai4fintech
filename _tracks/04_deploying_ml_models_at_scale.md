# Track 4: Deploying ML Models at Scale

Machine learning techniques have seen a tremendous increase of adoption over the last decade and this growth has been fueled by both advances on the algorithmic level and the ability to leverage hardware acceleration for making the algorithms run at scale. However, as ML models increasingly supplement or replace traditional business logic in decision making processes, it is critical to develop an understanding of how machine learning can be deployed at scale. Important considerations are the deployment, testing, and long-term maintenance of models. The goal is to investigate the systems aspects and building tools for automating this process.

The deployment of ML-applications brings in a unique set of engineering challenges. In particular if models are re-trained and re-deployed frequently, full automation of all relevant deployment tasks is needed. This includes monitoring and optimization in production, as well as data quality validation. For models requiring explainability, verification of not just outputs but also of the revised explanations will be necessary.
In this track we will seek to address such challenges at ING scale.
