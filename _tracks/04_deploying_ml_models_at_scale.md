The deployment of ML-applications brings in a unique set of engineering challenges. 
If the underlying data changes, this may lead to _concept drift_. We explore the use of _drift detectors_ to identify such situations, to minimize the (typically costly) training phase. 
Such drift detectors are employed while operating machine learning models, giving rise to the field of _ML-Ops_.

In this track, we explore various aspects of ML-Ops. This includes life cycle models for ML-based systems, data or project smells in ML-based systems, and energy consumption of such systems.
Concerning drift detection, we empirically compare detectors based on error rates and those based on data distribution, using synthetic and real world data. Furthermore, we investigate how drift detectors help in the context of monitoring IT infrastructure in production.

Research results include:

- An empirical comparison of state of the art drift detectors for ML models
- An analysis of the impact of selective retraining on energy consumption and accuracy
- Application of drift detection approaches in the ING AIOps context
- An assessment of AI lifecycle models and their applicability in the ING domain

The results have been presented at international workshops and conferences in the areas of big data, sustainability, and AI engineering. The results are collectively described in the dissertation of PhD candidate Lorena Poenaru-Olaru (defense date: fall 2025). After four successful years at TU Delft, in 2024 Lorena joined ING as a data scientist in the Real Estate Finance team.
