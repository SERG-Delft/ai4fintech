# Reinforcement Learning in Regulated Domains

Adaptivity and personalization can be of huge benefit in highly regulated domains, including
banking and finance and healthcare. Strong guarantees on safety of behaviour is a prerequisite for adoption of
systems in these domains.

This research is aimed at (a) bridging the gap between regulators’ and agent’s behaviour
representation, and (b) reinforcement learning under the resulting constraints aimed at the
application of an Adaptive Personal Assistant. It touches on practical and fundamental aspects of
explainability and safety of AI. How can we formalize regulations so that domain experts can
inspect, understand and validate the result?  How can we bridge the gap between experts’ and RL
agents’ representation of the world and actions?  How does constraining a RL agent impact its
learning capabilities? In this research, we use an adaptive conversational agent for financial
advice to investigate these issues.

This research is a collaboration with the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam's groups [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](https://krr.cs.vu.nl/) and
[Computational Intelligence](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) groups.
