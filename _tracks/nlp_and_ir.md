# Track 8: Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval

RegTech is a subset of FinTech aimed at delivering regulatory requirements more efficiently and effectively than existing capabilities. This particularly relates to Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD) requirements set in place to prevent banks from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering activities.

Current advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) open up new possibilities to strengthen KYC and CDD activities.
Written documents from regulators describe the constraints and requirements banks and their customers must adhere to.
The assessment of compliance is based on a series of data sources, which can be structured (stored in databases) or unstructured, in which case it is, again, written text.
The route that will be explored in the context of AFR is to use NLP to distill the requirements from regulatory documents automatically. With that in place, customer-related data, can be used to assess compliance. Here, again, for the unstructured parts, NLP techniques will be applied to distill elements that can be used for formal compliance evaluation.

One line of research in this track will focus on applying existing NLP techniques to the regulatory domain.
Furthermore, we anticipate that current NLP techniques may have to be adjusted to the regulatory domain.
Modern NLP techniques are largely statistical in nature, being trained on large bodies of existing text.
We anticipate that regulatory documents will have unique characteristics, requiring tailor-made NLP models.
ING's historic data of already conducted KYC and CDD assessments will provide the starting point for such tailor-made NLP models.
