# Track 9: User Experience and Personalization

In order to be able to optimally serve its customers' needs and demands, ING seeks to offer personalized and relevant customer journeys, on its mobile as well as its web platforms.
The underlying system interactions can be short term (one web session) as well as long term, spanning years if not decades, in case of, e.g., mortgages or pensions.

Within this track we seek to develop novel methods and techniques in the areas of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization (UMAP), within the context of banking.
Topics of interest include intelligent orchestration, personalized recommender engines, steering user behavior, user preference elicitation, web user profiles, adaptive navigation support, semantic web technologies, and the personalized social web.
