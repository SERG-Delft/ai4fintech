Over the past years, the software engineering research community has booked substantial progress in applying a variety of AI techniques to challenges of the software development process.

In many cases such ML-based software engineering tools give useful and meaningful results, for instance in the areas of program summarization or vulnerability detection. But how robust are such approaches? In this track we explore the use of _metamorphic transformations_ to understand whether such language model based tools maintain the required levels of performance when semantics-preserving transformations (such as refactorings or variable renamings) are applied the program under analysis.

A second successful line in AI-based software engineering relates to reformulating software engineering processes as _search-based problems_. 
In particular, _program repair_ can be considered as a _search_ for the right fix in a set of prossible code changes.
This requires a notion of correctness (a test suite that a correct fix should pass) as well as a fitness function that can guide the search process to a candidate fix that gets closer and closer to a proper fix.
In this track, we explore how such search-based program repair can leverage new types of test suites (such as property-based test suites) and sophisticated compiler infrastructure such as available in functional programming.

Research results include:

- Lampion, a framework for meta-morphic testing of machine-learning based program analysis tools
- A search-based approach to assess the robustness of ML-based program analysis tools
- PropR, a tool for property-based automated program repair for functional programming languages relying evolutionary search.
- A novel approach to conduct spectrum-based fault localization in functional programming

The results have been presented at top conferences in the area of software engineering. The results are collectively described in the dissertation of PhD candidate Leonhard Applis (defense date: September 2024).
