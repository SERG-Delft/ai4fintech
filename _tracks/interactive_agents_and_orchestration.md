# Track 7: Interactive Agents and Intelligent Orchestration

A part of compliance and due diligence in preventing abuse and fraud is tracking and verifying evidence and compliance documents. This process is labor-intensive, time consuming and error-prone due to its mostly manual nature. While automation seems the solution to this problem pure automation based on machine learning creates the possibility for gaming the system due to the closed nature of such networks and the inherent vulnerability to adversarial machine learning.

We propose to create an co-active agent to aid in the verification of compliance by facilitating collaboration between a human and specific limited machine learning agents into a coherent and efficient working process. 

A first version could simply provide humans with assistance on knowledge about compliance and policy, while a following version could gradually include more and more supporting AI system like analysis of evidence using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

A final version could extend the support agent concept to the client side to advise employees about compliance and evidence before submitting documents to the central repository to create awareness and prevention training on the policies and the reasons behind them and at the same time improving quality of submissions, further improving efficiency of policy verification.
