# Track 6: AI-Based Quality, Testing, and Security

Over the past few years, the software engineering research community has booked substantial progress in reformulating many software engineering processes as _search-based problems_. 

In particular, _testing_ can be considered as a _search_ for a set of test _cases_ that together meet a given _adequacy_ criterion, such as line coverage.
The search can start from randomly generated test inputs. These can then be _combined_ in such ways that the chances of increasing the coverage become higher and higher. This, then, gives rise to the application of _evolutionary algorithms_ for the purpose of software testing.
A well known research tool that reflects the state of the art is `evosuite.org`, to which TU Delft has contributed as well.

In the context of AFR, search-based testing techniques offer unique opportunities to further advance automated testing approaches within ING.
In particular, in this track we seek to lift search-based test generation techniques from the unit to the integration and system test levels. Furthermore, we will explore how search-based techniques can be used for the purpose of _security_ testing, bringing more intelligence, for example, to the current state of the art in fuzzing and penetration testing.
