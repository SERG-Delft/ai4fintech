title: Reinforcement Learning in Regulated Domains

---

Reinforcement learning is a powerful learning paradigm that can be used to learn how to behave
optimally from data. It has become increasingly popular over the past decades for various tasks,
including personalization. However, enforcing safety requirements onto the learned behaviors
remains an open challenge. Strong guarantees on safety is a prerequisite for adoption of systems
in practice.

This research is aimed at (a) bridging the gap between regulators’ and agent’s behaviour
representation, and (b) reinforcement learning under the resulting constraints aimed at the
application of an Adaptive Personal Assistant. It touches on practical and fundamental aspects of
explainability and safety of AI. How can we formalize regulations so that domain experts can
inspect, understand and validate the result?  How can we bridge the gap between experts’ and RL
agents’ representation of the world and actions?  How does constraining a RL agent impact its
learning capabilities? In this research, we use an adaptive conversational agent for financial
advice to investigate these issues.

This research is a collaboration with the Vrije
Universiteit Amsterdam's groups [Knowledge Representation and Reasoning](https://krr.cs.vu.nl/) and
[Computational Intelligence](https://cs.vu.nl/ci/) groups.
