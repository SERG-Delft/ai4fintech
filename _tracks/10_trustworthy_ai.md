# Track 10: Trustworthy AI

More and more software services in the banking domain rely on machine learning. This makes it crucial that the outcomes of the machine learning procedures in these services can be trusted. To be able to assess this, the [7 key requirements of the EU’s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence](https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation) (Human agency and oversight; Technical Robustness and safety; Privacy and data governance; Transparency; Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; Societal and environmental well-being; Accountability) will need concrete operationalization for the Fintech domain.

In several previous applications of machine learning (and statistical modeling), it has been found that concepts of ‘trust in’ and ‘correctness of’ models are not always clear-cut. Models that seem to perform well according to common performance metrics, may show unexpected behavior in the wild. Seemingly minor researcher degrees of freedom may have major outcomes on final results, and model outcomes may be misinterpreted, even by data scientists.

This calls for stronger quality assurance procedures throughout the machine learning application workflow. The research conducted in this track will focus on enabling and supporting such procedures, which pro-actively should include both humans and algorithms in the decision-making loop.
